An attempt to take the pain out of wysiwyg editing

**This project is currently under active development. (See update above)**

Hey there. I'm still working on this. I published an earlier version of the code but I had to take that code offline (or at least bury in under some commits) as I decided to make it part of a course in my master's degree. I recently had an epiphany and I'm changing essential parts of the code. When I'm done, I'll release everything :)
